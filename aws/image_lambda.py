# This lambda function demonstrates the use of the AWS IoT Greengrass Image Classification
# Connector. It will capture an image using a Raspberry Pi PiCamera, make an
# inference using the IoT GreengrassImage Classification Connector (via the IoT Greengrass
# machine learning SDK), and report the result back to a topic. Additionally, this will
# check the prediction confidence of the inference and upload the result to S3 where it can be
# manually labeled for use in future SageMaker training jobs.
#
# To be used alongside part 2 of the accompanying blog post.
